# OneNoteToolSwitcher
Description:

This AutoHotkey script is developed specifically for users who take handwritten notes in OneNote using a pen tablet. It enables the toggling between two frequently used tools in OneNote, which is particularly useful when OneNote doesn't offer native keyboard shortcuts for this purpose.

Key Features:

Tool Toggle for Pen Tablets: Designed for users who use pen tablets for note-taking in OneNote, allowing them to switch between two primary tools efficiently.
Configurable for Specific OneNote Setup: The script works with OneNote when configured with one tool in the 3rd position and another in the 9th position of the Quick Access Toolbar.
Pen Return Functionality: Automatically returns to the last-used pen from the 16 pens available in the toolbar, enhancing the note-taking process.
Custom Hotkeys for Pen-Tablet Buttons: Easily set up your pen-tablet buttons to correspond with the script's hotkeys for seamless tool switching.
Setup Requirements:

OneNote must be configured with the two desired tools placed specifically in the 3rd and 9th positions of the Quick Access Toolbar.
Exactly 16 pens should be present in the OneNote toolbar for the script to function correctly.
The script is intended to be used with configurable buttons on a pen-tablet, which should be set to the keystrokes defined in the script.
How It Works:

The script responds to predefined hotkeys, which should be mapped to the buttons on your pen-tablet. Pressing these buttons will switch between the two tools set in your OneNote Quick Access Toolbar. When switching back from a tool, the script automatically selects the last used pen from your toolbar.

Getting Started:

To use this script, clone the repository, ensure your OneNote and pen-tablet are configured as per the requirements, and run the script. You may need to modify the hotkey bindings in the script to match your pen-tablet button configuration.
